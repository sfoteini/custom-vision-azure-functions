# Serverless image classification with Azure Functions and Custom Vision 

Welcome to the new series focused on Azure Custom Vision and Azure Functions! In the **"Serverless image classification with Azure Functions and Custom Vision"** series, you are going to train a TensorFlow image classification model in Azure Custom Vision and run the model in an Azure Function.

You will learn how to build a serverless HTTP API with Azure Functions and Azure Custom Vision. By the end o this series you will be able to:

- Train and publish an image classifier using the Custom Vision SDK for Python.
- Export a TensorFlow model using the Python SDK and run the model locally to classify images.
- Import a TensorFlow machine learning model into an Azure Function.
- Build a serverless HTTP API for classifying images.
